### (Digital Design and Verification Enthusiast)


I'm a final year electronics undergraduate student and I do have great interest in Digital VLSI, FPGA prototyping, RTL Design and verification. In my undergrad I have tinkered a lot with FPGAs, Microcontrollers and circuit designs. I have made my small RISC-V core in verilog. Also made a 8 bit computer using SAP (Simple as possible!) Logic and simulated it in Logisim. </br>
I'm a former verification Research Intern at SHAKTI , RISE LAB, IITM. SHAKTI is an open-source initiative by RISE group at IIT-Madras with the aim to produce production grade processors, complete System on Chips (SoCs), development boards and SHAKTI-based software platform.
I was selected in Google Summer of Code 2021 (GSOC'21) with beagleboard org. I had worked on a FPGA cape named BeagleWire and developed Gateware for it. <br>
I'm always open to Research opportunities in Computer Architecture, RTL Design, Verification and FPGA prototyping.
